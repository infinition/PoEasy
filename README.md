Hi everyone !
It's a tool to create  keyboard shortcuts macros for Path of exile (And all other games and application)

This tool allow you to link/assign keyboard keys to other keys.

Example :

- When i press on "²" or "F"  it can return  simultaneously specific key that you defined, example &é"'( or azert
- When i press "F1" or "F2" it can return simultaneously specific key that you defined too
- To avoid eventual issue, i've created an option to specify a minimum and maximum random delay (The value you specify will be divided by 1000).

- In the path of exile case, i've assigned the ² key to ²&é"' , it trigger all the potions simultaneously within the specified min-max delay ;)
It simplified my gamplay on PC Gamepad controllers as you can now assign 1 key to trigger multiple actions ;)

As it's a work in progress program, you may encounter some problems, for example, you won't be able to change the predifined shortcuts after clicking on "Run", you will have to re run the program.
 - However you can set different delay time in the fields the delay times without retarting the program.
 - You can also change the keys returned by the defined shortcut without restarting the program.
 - For the moment you can assign 2 keyboard keys, i will increase the number later. 
 
 UI :
 - 1 - First field = Minimun delay (The field cannot be empty, the value you specify will be devided by 1000)
 - 2 - Second field = Maximum delay (The field cannot be empty, The value you specify will be devided by 1000)
 - 3 - Third field = This is when you put the first desired shorcturt key, example : f1 or ² or page_down (It can be empty)
 - 4 - Fourth field = This is when you put the second desired shorcturt key, example : f2 or page_up or g (It can be empty)
 - 5 - Fifth field = This is where you define what key(s) will be return when you press the First shortcut key (The field cannot be empty is a shortcut is specified)
 - 6 - Fifth field = This is where you define what key(s) will be return when you press the Second shortcut key (The field cannot be empty is a shortcut is specified)
 - 7 - Start button = It runs the program
 ->>>> To stop the program, close the window.
 
 *TIPS
