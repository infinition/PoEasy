It's a tool to create  keyboard shortcuts macros for  games and application.

This tool allow you to link/assign keyboard keys to other keys.

Example :

- When i press on "²" or "F"  it can return  simultaneously specific key that you defined, example &é"'( or azert
- When i press "F1" or "F2" it can return simultaneously specific key that you defined too
- To avoid eventual issue, i've created an option to specify a minimum and maximum random delay (The value you specify will be divided by 1000) so if you specify "100" it will define 100ms.

- In the path of exile case, i've assigned the ² key to ²&é"' , it trigger all the potions simultaneously within the specified min-max delay.
It simplified the  gameplay on PC Gamepad controllers as you can now assign 1 key to trigger multiple actions.

 
 UI :
 - 1 - First field = Minimun delay (The field cannot be empty, the value you specify will be devided by 1000)
 - 2 - Second field = Maximum delay (The field cannot be empty, The value you specify will be devided by 1000)
 - 3 - Third field = This is when you put the first desired shorcturt key, example : f1 or ² or page_down (It can be empty)
 - 4 - Fourth field = This is when you put the second desired shorcturt key, example : f2 or page_up or g (It can be empty)
 - 5 - Fifth field = This is where you define what key(s) will be return when you press the First shortcut key (The field cannot be empty is a shortcut is specified)
 - 6 - Fifth field = This is where you define what key(s) will be return when you press the Second shortcut key (The field cannot be empty is a shortcut is specified)
 - 7 - Start button = It runs the program
 - 8 - Erase button = It stops the program

 *TIPS
 
 To define F1 don't press the F1 key to define it, write literally "F1"  in the field.
 f1 = The function keys. F1 to F20 are defined.
